 # To-Do App with React and MongoDB

A simple To-Do list application built using React for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend. This project demonstrates how to create a full-stack application that allows users to manage tasks with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

## Features

- **View tasks**: Display all tasks in a clean, organized list.
- **Update tasks**: Mark tasks as completed or edit their details.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent storage**: Store tasks in MongoDB, which ensures data persists even after the application is restarted.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **API**: RESTful API using Express to interact with MongoDB
- **Styling**: CSS/Styled-components (or any preferred styling method)
